2. Which is longer: user time or sys time? Use your knowledge to explain why.
3. When downloading the files above, which downloader finishes faster? Why? Please Explain.
4. Repeat the experiment for 10 files (any reasonably large-sized les, e.g., 100 MB, will do). Is the downloader in the previous question still faster? If not so, why? Please Explain.
